is 420

0:21:01.360,0:21:07.440
or not pink which is 422

0:21:04.960,0:21:08.400
don't forget that it doesn't make sense

0:21:07.440,0:21:17.840
to make sense

0:21:08.400,0:21:17.840
i know for your home how do we do

0:21:27.280,0:21:34.080
wait hold on hold on um

0:21:31.280,0:21:35.200
zip service yeah but we could censor and

0:21:34.080,0:21:37.679
host the services

0:21:35.200,0:21:39.520
bro we could actually do bn vpn like

0:21:37.679,0:21:41.360
just get the site and then just keep

0:21:39.520,0:21:44.080
everyone like one [ __ ]

0:21:41.360,0:21:45.360
you know [ __ ] open one megabyte of

0:21:44.080,0:21:48.400
traffic yeah one one

0:21:45.360,0:21:50.880
one open vpn program and and then make

0:21:48.400,0:21:52.640
it like 256 kilobits per second

0:21:50.880,0:21:55.840
and then just so why open vpn dude i'll

0:21:52.640,0:21:57.120
do wire guard i mean yeah why not yeah

0:21:55.840,0:21:58.320
it'll be it's already gonna be so

0:21:57.120,0:22:00.400
[ __ ] slow maybe it'll make it a

0:21:58.320,0:22:02.960
little bit faster

0:22:00.400,0:22:03.520
it doesn't make any sense i mean that's

0:22:02.960,0:22:05.280
it

0:22:03.520,0:22:08.880
man that's a selling point it's already

0:22:05.280,0:22:08.880
so [ __ ] slow we tried to make it

0:22:09.840,0:22:13.200
as efficient

0:22:17.400,0:22:20.459
[Music]

0:22:24.840,0:22:30.159
[ __ ] yes

0:22:27.919,0:22:32.159
if you go into here you can see that

0:22:30.159,0:22:34.000
like every every service is like online

0:22:32.159,0:22:35.679
right now as we speak

0:22:34.000,0:22:37.280
but then we're gonna have pnvpn and

0:22:35.679,0:22:38.000
we're gonna make it like a special

0:22:37.280,0:22:39.360
section

0:22:38.000,0:22:42.559
even we know the [ __ ] you know and it's

0:22:39.360,0:22:42.559
going to be in yellow all the time

0:22:43.919,0:22:47.840
and then we're going to have it then

0:22:46.480,0:22:50.320
we're going to have it like randomly

0:22:47.840,0:22:50.320
reboot

0:22:51.679,0:22:56.159
and send emails to the people who have

0:22:53.919,0:23:00.400
registered

0:22:56.159,0:23:03.679
hello so annoying time again

0:23:00.400,0:23:09.840
every day every time crashes because

0:23:03.679,0:23:09.840
there's more than two users

0:23:12.640,0:23:15.919
then we're gonna [ __ ] wait for like

0:23:15.200,0:23:18.320
10 minutes

0:23:15.919,0:23:19.120
and then send a [ __ ] emails to all

0:23:18.320,0:23:22.880
the people who

0:23:19.120,0:23:22.880
ever used it all

0:23:31.039,0:23:34.960
like every time a person would register

0:23:33.440,0:23:38.480
we would just give them a name

0:23:34.960,0:23:38.480
bn1 bm2

0:23:41.120,0:23:46.400
and every single inbox would be just one

inbox running some super [ __ ] old

0:23:46.400,0:23:51.840
